## TellCo Telecom Data Analysis and Dashboard Project

##### This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from TellCo, a mobile service provider, to extract meaningful insights about customer engagement, experience, and satisfaction. It combines data analytics, machine learning, and software engineering to build a comprehensive dashboard and predictive models. The project is designed to showcase advanced coding practices, deployment pipelines, and end-to-end problem-solving capabilities.
### Features

    Data Preprocessing:
        Standardized handling of missing values and outliers.
        Conversion of metrics for better interpretability (e.g., bytes to megabytes).

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Insights into customer engagement and network performance.
        Cluster-based segmentation of users based on engagement and experience.

    Machine Learning Models:
        K-means clustering for customer segmentation.
        Regression model for predicting customer satisfaction.

    Dashboard:
        Interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs).
        User-friendly design with dynamic filters and charts.

    Deployment:
        Dockerized application for portability.
        CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

#### Technologies Used

### Key Features of the Dashboard

##### Engagement Metrics:
        Breakdown of data usage by categories such as social media, gaming, and streaming.
##### Experience Metrics:
        Insights into network performance metrics like throughput and latency.
##### Satisfaction Insights:
        Visualizations of user satisfaction scores and cluster-based segmentation.
##### Interactivity:
        Filters for exploring data by region, time, or other criteria.

### Usage

    Open the dashboard in a browser (default: http://localhost:8501).
    Navigate through the tabs to explore engagement, experience, and satisfaction metrics.
    Use filters to customize your analysis.

### Project Goals

    Demonstrate advanced Python coding techniques.
    Showcase the integration of machine learning with business analytics.
    Provide actionable insights for telecom stakeholders.
    Create a portfolio project aligned with industry best practices.
